## Driver Drowsiness Detection System

The app is developed that continuously monitors the drowsiness of a driver by recognizing the driver eyes. The app is useful for the drivers to avoid night time drowsiness while driving which cause the accident.

## Working 

The project includes direct working with the 68 facial landmark detector and also the face detector of the Dlib library. The 68 facial landmark detector is a robustly trained efficient detector which detects the points on the human face using which we determine whether the eyes are open or they are closed.
